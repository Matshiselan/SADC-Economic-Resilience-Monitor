## Project Overview (STAR Method)

**Situation:**
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries face recurring macro-fiscal risks and shocks, with policymakers needing timely, explainable, and actionable early-warning insights.

**Task:**
Design and implement an automated, multi-agent system to monitor, audit, model, simulate, and report on macro-fiscal risks for all 16 SADC countries, supporting Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, and development partners.

**Action:**
- Built a modular Python pipeline using agents for data harvesting, quality auditing, risk modeling, scenario simulation, policy intelligence, and report generation.
- Integrated real World Bank/IMF data, robust data quality checks, explainable risk scoring, and advanced scenario simulation (Monte Carlo, Bayesian VAR, local projections).
- Automated the production of concise, visually engaging policy briefs and dashboards, with clear data quality and policy recommendations.

**Result:**
- Delivers yearly, explainable, and actionable macro-fiscal risk assessments for all SADC countries.
- Enables evidence-based policy dialogue and rapid response to emerging risks, with transparent data quality and scenario analysis.
