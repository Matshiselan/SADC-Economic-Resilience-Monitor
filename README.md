## Project Overview

Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries face recurring macro-fiscal risks and shocks. Policymakers require timely, explainable, and actionable early-warning insights to support financial stability and resilience.

This repository provides an automated, multi-agent system that monitors, audits, models, simulates, and reports on macro-fiscal risks for all 16 SADC countries. The system supports Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, and development partners by:

- Using modular Python agents for data harvesting, quality auditing, risk modeling, scenario simulation, policy intelligence, and report generation
- Integrating real World Bank/IMF data, robust data quality checks, explainable risk scoring, and advanced scenario simulation (Monte Carlo, Bayesian VAR, local projections)
- Producing concise, visually engaging policy briefs and dashboards, with clear data quality and policy recommendations

The result is a yearly, explainable, and actionable macro-fiscal risk assessment for each SADC country. This enables evidence-based policy dialogue and rapid response to emerging risks, with transparent data quality and scenario analysis.
