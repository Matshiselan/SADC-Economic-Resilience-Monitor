Ollama Executive Summary: Angola
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Angola’s fiscal risk flag has remained in the medium band throughout the sample, reflecting persistent macro‑fiscal vulnerabilities. The most acute pressure derives from repeatedly high inflation, especially in the early 1990s hyper‑inflation episode and the post‑2015 period where consumer price growth regularly exceeded 20 %. Debt data are missing, limiting the ability to fully assess balance‑sheet risks, but the persistence of inflation‐driven monetary tightening signals heightened debt‑service concerns.

**Key Trends**  
From 1991 onward, Angola experienced successive inflation spikes that triggered automated recommendations for aggressive rate hikes. While inflation moderated after 2005, a resurgence occurred after 2015, with inflation hovering above 20 % and peaking at 33 % in 2024. Economic growth has been uneven, swinging from negative to double‑digit rebounds, but has not delivered a sustained expansion, with GDP growth averaging just above 3 % in recent years. Episodes of low growth in the early 1980s and occasional medium‑risk periods in 2015, 2023, and 2024 prompted counter‑cyclical fiscal stimulus recommendations modelled on Botswana’s 2009 experience.

**Policy Implications**  
Policymakers must continue to anchor inflation expectations through disciplined monetary tightening, emphasizing credibility, transparent policy communication, and a calibrated interest‑rate path that avoids excessive real‑rate spikes. Simultaneously, targeted fiscal stimulus—focused on productive investment, social safety nets, and diversification away from oil dependence—should be deployed during growth lulls to prevent a debt spiral and to support inclusive recovery. Strengthening debt reporting and establishing a comprehensive fiscal risk register are essential to improve monitoring and early‑warning capacity.

**Conclusion**  
Angola’s medium‑risk classification is driven chiefly by entrenched inflation volatility and data gaps on debt. A dual approach of firm monetary anchoring combined with judicious, project‑based fiscal stimulus will mitigate inflationary shocks, sustain growth, and enhance fiscal resilience ahead of the 2025 SADC fiscal consolidation framework.

Ollama Executive Summary: Botswana
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Botswana’s fiscal risk score of 7.37 signals a moderate exposure to macro‑fiscal volatility. The early‑warning flag registers as MEDIUM for 68 % of the observations, LOW for the remaining periods and never reaches HIGH. The dominant risk drivers are rising public‑debt ratios (peaking above 19 % of GDP in 2009‑2022) and a persistently volatile growth path, with sharp contractions in 2009, 2020 and 2024. Inflation has generally been contained below 12 % after 2010, yet historical spikes above 15 % in the 1970s–1980s illustrate sensitivity to external shocks.

**Key Trends**  
Since the late 2000s, Botswana has experienced a structural shift: debt accumulation coincides with lower, often negative, real growth and a transition from high‑growth, low‑inflation episodes of the 1970s to a more subdued macro‑environment. Data gaps are evident—debt figures are missing for many pre‑1990 years—limiting a full long‑run assessment. The pattern of “counter‑cyclical fiscal stimulus” recommendations for downturns (2009, 2012, 2020, 2024) reflects the system’s identification of fiscal space as a buffer, whereas isolated calls for FX management (1976) and monetary tightening (1981, 1992) arise when inflationary pressures exceed 16 %.

**Policy Implications**  
In periods of deteriorating growth and rising debt, the Ministry should deploy targeted, time‑bound fiscal stimulus that safeguards critical investment while preserving debt sustainability. Strengthening FX market interventions can help contain imported inflation when external shocks materialise. When inflation breaches the mid‑teens, the Central Bank must act decisively with rate hikes to anchor expectations. Across all years, improving the timeliness and completeness of fiscal data—especially debt stock—will enhance early‑warning accuracy and policy calibration.

**Conclusion**  
Botswana faces moderate fiscal risk driven by elevated debt and growth volatility. A balanced policy mix—targeted fiscal support during downturns, vigilant FX and monetary management during inflation spikes, and upgraded data systems—will reinforce macro‑economic stability and keep the risk flag in the LOW category.

Ollama Executive Summary: Comoros
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Comoros exhibits a moderate fiscal risk score (2.62) with early‑year alerts largely “LOW” but a persistent “MEDIUM” flag from the mid‑1980s onward. The risk rating is driven by volatile real growth, recurring negative growth episodes, and a sharp inflation surge in 2022‑2023. Crucially, debt data are missing for the entire series, limiting a full assessment of solvency pressures.

**Key Trends**  
Growth has oscillated between strong expansions (≥7 % in the early 1990s) and deep contractions (‑6 % in 1991, ‑1.8 % in 2006, ‑0.2 % in 2020). Inflation, absent before 2001, has risen dramatically, peaking at 18 % in 2022. The early‑period policy engine repeatedly suggests foreign‑exchange (FX) management and import compression, mirroring Mozambique’s 2016 response. From the late 1990s onward, the template switches to counter‑cyclical, targeted fiscal stimulus akin to Botswana’s 2009 approach whenever growth turns negative or inflation spikes. Over 40 % of observations trigger a “expert review” recommendation, reflecting the absence of a matching policy template.

**Policy Implications**  
Immediate actions should focus on strengthening FX market interventions to curb import‑driven price pressures and on building a credible, rules‑based fiscal stimulus framework that can be rapidly deployed during downturns. Given the data gaps, a rapid audit of public debt and external liabilities is essential to calibrate debt sustainability analyses. Enhancing statistical capacity to produce timely, consistent inflation and debt metrics will improve early‑warning accuracy.

**Conclusion**  
Comoros faces moderate fiscal risk amplified by growth volatility, rising inflation, and serious data deficiencies. Prioritising FX stabilization, establishing a pre‑approved stimulus mechanism, and closing debt‑data gaps will mitigate fiscal vulnerability and support macro‑economic stability for the coming decade.

Ollama Executive Summary: Eswatini
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Eswatini’s fiscal‑risk score of 4.81 places the economy in a moderate‑risk band. The early‑warning flag oscillates between *LOW* and *MEDIUM* with no occurrence of *HIGH* risk, reflecting a generally manageable but still vulnerable macro‑fiscal environment. The most persistent pressure comes from inflation volatility and a rising public‑debt burden that accelerated after 2015, peaking at roughly 38 % of GDP in 2020. Data gaps are pronounced: debt, inflation and growth series contain many “nan” entries, especially for the post‑COVID period, limiting diagnostic certainty.

**Key Trends**  
From the 1970s through the early 2000s, high inflation spikes routinely triggered model‑based recommendations for aggressive monetary tightening. Since the mid‑2000s, the pattern shifted toward suggestions for foreign‑exchange (FX) management, mirroring Mozambique’s 2016 experience, as the country faced persistent import‑price pressures and a depreciating currency. Fiscal stimulus recommendations appear only in a handful of downturns (e.g., 2008‑2009, 1976, 1978) when growth turned negative. Over the last decade, debt ratios have risen steadily while inflation has moderated, yet the lack of reliable recent data introduces uncertainty about the current inflation trajectory and fiscal buffers.

**Policy Implications**  
The ministerial agenda should prioritize three actions. First, reinforce FX market interventions and import‑priced inflation controls, preserving exchange‑rate stability while avoiding excess reserve depletion. Second, retain a calibrated monetary‑tightening toolkit—moderate rate hikes when core inflation threatens to re‑accelerate—paired with clear communication to anchor expectations. Third, develop a counter‑cyclical fiscal buffer: a modest, targeted stimulus (e.g., infrastructure work or social safety nets) ready for deployment when growth falls below 2 % and debt service pressures intensify. Immediate investment in statistical capacity is essential to close data gaps, enabling timely policy calibration.

**Conclusion**  
Eswatini faces a moderate fiscal‑risk environment driven by inflation volatility and a climbing debt profile, compounded by incomplete macro‑data. A balanced mix of FX management, prudent monetary tightening, and a ready‑to‑use fiscal stimulus framework, underpinned by stronger data systems, will safeguard macro‑stability and support sustainable growth.

Ollama Executive Summary: Lesotho
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Lesotho’s fiscal risk score of 3.88 reflects a persistently medium‑level early‑warning flag across the three‑decade record, with only intermittent low‑risk years in the 1990s and early 2000s. Inflation has been volatile, frequently exceeding 15 % in the 1970s–1990s, prompting automated recommendations for aggressive monetary tightening. Since 2005 inflation has moderated but remains above 6 % on average, while public debt data are missing for many years and become sporadic after 2008, limiting precise debt‑sustainability assessment.

**Key Trends**  
The economy displays low and sometimes negative real growth, especially during global shocks (e.g., 2009, 2020), triggering repeated algorithmic advice for counter‑cyclical fiscal stimulus. The period 1970‑1995 shows a pattern of high inflation shocks answered by suggested rate hikes, whereas the post‑2000 era is dominated by calls for targeted fiscal support rather than monetary tightening. Data gaps in debt stocks and occasional absent inflation figures create uncertainty in evaluating fiscal space.

**Policy Implications**  
Policy makers should rebuild fiscal buffers through disciplined spending and revenue mobilisation, prioritising a transparent, regularly updated debt register. When growth contracts, implement a limited, well‑targeted stimulus—focused on job‑creating sectors and social safety nets—to avoid widening deficits. Maintain a cautious monetary stance: keep policy rates sufficiently high to anchor expectations, but avoid abrupt hikes that could strain the banking sector. Strengthen foreign‑exchange management tools to mitigate imported inflation, drawing on Mozambique‑type interventions where appropriate.

**Conclusion**  
Lesotho faces medium‑level fiscal risk amplified by data deficiencies and a history of inflation volatility. A balanced approach that reinforces fiscal data quality, preserves modest buffers, and deploys precise, counter‑cyclical stimulus when growth falters will enhance resilience and support sustainable macro‑fiscal stability.

Ollama Executive Summary: Madagascar
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Madagascar’s fiscal risk flag has hovered between LOW and MEDIUM over the past five decades, with no HIGH alerts. The mean fiscal‑risk score (based on GDP growth) is modest at 1.9 %. The dominant risk drivers are volatile inflation – often exceeding 20 % during the late 1970s, early 1980s and mid‑1990s – and occasional negative growth bursts. Debt data are missing throughout, limiting a full assessment of debt sustainability. The most recent years (2021‑2024) are flagged LOW, but data gaps in 2024 (inflation and debt) reduce confidence.

**Key Trends**  
From the 1970s through the early 1990s, episodes of runaway inflation prompted modelled recommendations for aggressive monetary tightening. Parallel periods of exchange‑rate stress and import‑price spikes generated advice on foreign‑exchange interventions and import‑compression measures, echoing Mozambique’s 2016 experience. In the early 2000s, a mix of moderate inflation and growth volatility led to alternating calls for monetary tightening and FX management. The COVID‑19 shock in 2020 revived the need for a targeted, counter‑cyclical fiscal stimulus, while the post‑pandemic window (2021‑2024) shows low flag levels but lacks robust debt and inflation reporting.

**Policy Implications**  
Maintain a flexible policy toolkit: (1) retain the ability to tighten monetary policy swiftly when inflation pressures re‑emerge; (2) develop a credible FX‑management framework, including transparent intervention rules and targeted import‑substitution incentives; (3) preserve fiscal space for rapid, targeted stimulus during external shocks, focusing on health, social safety nets and productive public investment. Prioritise the establishment of a comprehensive debt‑tracking system and improve real‑time inflation monitoring to close current data gaps.

**Conclusion**  
Madagascar faces moderate fiscal risk, driven principally by inflation volatility and exchange‑rate pressures. Strengthening data infrastructure and preserving policy flexibility will enable the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to respond efficiently to future shocks while supporting sustainable growth.

Ollama Executive Summary: Malawi
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Malawi’s fiscal‑risk flag has been predominantly *Medium* over the past five decades, with only occasional *Low* alerts and no *High* warnings. The mean fiscal‑risk score (3.96) reflects modest growth coupled with elevated inflationary pressures, especially in the 1980‑1990 s and again from 2012 onward. Data gaps are evident—debt and inflation figures are missing for many early years—limiting precise trend quantification and obscuring potential structural breaks.

**Key Trends**  
From the early 1970s through the 1990s, inflation spikes above 20 % repeatedly triggered automated advice for aggressive interest‑rate hikes, mirroring IMF‑style stabilization programs. Post‑2008, lower inflation and modest growth shifted the algorithmic recommendation toward foreign‑exchange (FX) interventions and import‑compression measures, a pattern that persisted until 2011. Since 2012, rising public‑debt ratios (peaking at 55.6 % of GDP in 2022) and a resurgence of inflation above 20 % have once again produced a *Medium* risk flag with a strong bias toward monetary tightening. The most recent years (2022‑2024) exhibit the highest inflation readings (21‑32 %) and the same tightening recommendation, indicating a re‑emergence of macro‑price instability.

**Policy Implications**  
Policy must address the dual challenge of price stability and debt sustainability. Immediate action should focus on disciplined monetary tightening—aggressive policy‑rate adjustments—to anchor inflation expectations, as consistently advised by the model for the current environment. Complementary FX‑market management can mitigate external shocks, but should be calibrated to avoid undue pressure on foreign‑exchange reserves. Fiscal policy should remain prudently expansionary: targeted, counter‑cyclical stimulus is warranted only when growth falls below potential and debt servicing capacity is preserved. Strengthening statistical systems to close the data gaps on debt and inflation will improve early‑warning accuracy.

**Conclusion**  
Malawi’s macro‑fiscal outlook is characterised by medium‑level risk, with inflationary pressures driving the prevailing policy signal toward monetary tightening. Coupled with rising debt, this calls for a coordinated response that combines decisive rate hikes, judicious FX interventions, and carefully calibrated fiscal support, while urgently enhancing data quality to inform future risk assessments.

Ollama Executive Summary: Mauritius
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Mauritius’ fiscal risk score averages 4.65, reflecting a generally moderate stance but with periodic vulnerability. The early warning flag is low for most of the record, rising to medium in a handful of years (notably 1970‑1976, 1979‑1984, 1999, 2005, 2019‑2022). Data gaps for debt in the 1970s and post‑2015 years limit precision, and the sharp increase in public‑debt‑to‑GDP from ~30 % in the early 2000s to over 55 % after 2016 marks a structural shift that warrants close monitoring.

**Key Trends**  
Inflation has been the dominant driver of risk, spiking above 30 % in the mid‑1970s and again in the early 1980s, prompting model‑based recommendations for monetary tightening. Since the mid‑2000s, inflation has been modest (mostly 3‑6 %) while debt ratios have risen steadily, coinciding with a transition from ad‑hoc fiscal stimulus to a reliance on expert review. The pandemic year 2020 triggered a resurgence of the stimulus template, highlighting sensitivity to external shocks.

**Policy Implications**  
When inflation threatens to exceed the central‑bank target, a calibrated rate‑hike cycle should be employed to anchor expectations, avoiding over‑tightening that could impair growth. In downturns or shock periods, a targeted, counter‑cyclical fiscal package—focused on social safety nets and productive investment—remains appropriate, as evidenced by the 2020 recommendation. Persistent medium‑risk flags and rising debt levels call for strengthening fiscal buffers, improving debt data transparency, and establishing a formal review mechanism to replace the current “expert review” ad‑hoc approach. FX market volatility, which historically prompted intervention advice, should be managed through prudent foreign‑exchange reserves and limited import compression policies rather than abrupt market distortions.

**Conclusion**  
Mauritius enjoys a predominantly low‑risk fiscal environment, yet medium‑risk episodes tied to inflation spikes and a rapidly expanding debt stock pose future challenges. Strengthening debt reporting, preserving fiscal space, and deploying calibrated monetary and fiscal tools during shocks will help sustain macro‑fiscal stability and support inclusive growth.

Ollama Executive Summary: Mozambique
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Mozambique’s fiscal risk score of 4.81 places the country in a moderate‑to‑high alert zone. The early‑warning flag has been consistently MEDIUM since the early 2000s, with occasional LOW alerts during periods of strong growth. The most recent years (2020‑2024) show persistent MEDIUM risk, driven by elevated public‑debt ratios (above 70 % of GDP), inflation volatility (peaking at 22.9 % in 2016), and modest growth momentum. Data gaps for debt and other variables prior to the 2000s limit the depth of long‑run analysis.

**Key Trends**  
From 2005 onward, inflation spikes coincided with external shocks, prompting automated recommendations for FX interventions and import compression in 2012, 2015 and 2022. The 2016‑2017 period saw sharply higher inflation and debt, triggering a shift toward monetary tightening modeled on IMF‑supported programs. Post‑COVID‑19, debt rose above 100 % of GDP in 2020 before a gradual decline, while growth has remained sluggish (around 2‑5 %). Fiscal consolidation pressures reappeared in 2020, mirroring Zambia’s 2015‑2018 experience.

**Policy Implications**  
Policy makers should prioritize a calibrated fiscal consolidation path of 1½–2 % of GDP, preserving social spending to sustain growth. Monetary policy must remain vigilant, allowing targeted rate hikes to anchor inflation expectations without choking recovery. Strengthening FX market management—through occasional interventions and disciplined import compression—will dampen exchange‑rate‑driven price shocks. Improving data collection on debt, fiscal balances and external positions is essential for early‑warning accuracy.

**Conclusion**  
Mozambique faces a medium‑level fiscal risk profile marked by high debt, inflation volatility and limited data transparency. A dual strategy of prudent fiscal consolidation, disciplined monetary tightening, and proactive FX management, underpinned by better statistical reporting, will mitigate vulnerabilities and support sustainable growth ahead.

Ollama Executive Summary: Namibia
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Namibia’s fiscal‑risk flag has oscillated between MEDIUM and LOW over the past four decades, with no HIGH alerts recorded. The mean fiscal‑risk score of 2.95 reflects modest vulnerability, but the persistence of MEDIUM ratings during periods of negative or sluggish growth (e.g., 1983‑84, 2007‑09, 2016‑20) signals a propensity for fiscal stress when output contracts. Gaps in debt and inflation data—particularly the prevalence of “nan” entries before the 2000s—reduce the precision of the assessment and warrant immediate improvement in statistical reporting.

**Key Trends**  
From 1981‑1995 the economy experienced frequent growth slow‑downs, prompting the model to advise targeted counter‑cyclical stimulus, mirroring Botswana’s 2009 response. From the mid‑1990s onward, the dominant recommendation shifted to foreign‑exchange (FX) management and import compression, echoing Mozambique’s 2016 experience, coinciding with rising inflation (peaking at 12 % in 2008‑09) and occasional debt‑to‑GDP spikes. Since 2010 the risk flag has settled largely on LOW, yet the automated system repeatedly suggests “expert review” for years lacking a clear template, indicating that underlying dynamics—such as sectoral shocks or fiscal‑policy mix—are not fully captured.

**Policy Implications**  
When growth turns negative, the Ministry should deploy a focused fiscal stimulus that protects essential public services while preserving debt sustainability; this may include temporary tax rebates or accelerated infrastructure spending in high‑multipliers sectors. Persistent inflation and exchange‑rate pressures call for a disciplined FX‑intervention framework, transparent reserve‑use guidelines, and measures to curb import‑led demand spikes. Strengthening fiscal buffers (e.g., a multi‑year rainy‑day fund) and improving debt‑reporting standards will enhance early‑warning capacity. Coordination with the central bank is essential to align monetary tightening with fiscal actions, avoiding policy fragmentation.

**Conclusion**  
Namibia’s fiscal risk remains moderate but is highly sensitive to growth downturns and inflationary shocks. A dual strategy of targeted stimulus during recessions and robust FX management during inflation spikes, underpinned by better data collection and inter‑agency coordination, will mitigate fiscal vulnerabilities and support sustainable macro‑economic stability.

Ollama Executive Summary: Tanzania
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Tanzania’s fiscal‑risk score of 3.53 places the economy in the moderate‑risk band. The historical record shows a persistent “Medium” early‑warning flag during the 1970s‑1990s, driven primarily by volatile inflation and absent debt data, while the most recent decade is characterised by a “Low” flag and comparatively benign macro‑variables. The absence of reliable sovereign‑debt figures throughout the series limits a full assessment of fiscal sustainability.

**Key Trends**  
From 1970 through the early 1990s, inflation regularly exceeded 20 % and, after simulated shocks, surged to above 30 %. During those periods the automated advice favoured aggressive monetary tightening and, on occasion, foreign‑exchange (FX) market interventions to curb import‑driven pressures. By the 2000s inflation fell to the high single‑digit range and growth stabilized above 6 %, prompting a shift toward “Low” risk flags and a default recommendation for expert review. Recent shocks (2020‑2024) have produced modest inflation (≈3–9 %) and steady growth, yet the system still suggests expert oversight rather than a preset policy template.

**Policy Implications**  
Maintain a calibrated monetary stance: be prepared to tighten rates swiftly when inflation breaches the 8‑10 % threshold, echoing the historical success of aggressive hikes in anchoring expectations. Preserve the capacity for selective FX interventions to manage import‑price pass‑through during external volatility, as evidenced in the 1970s‑1990s episodes. While the current environment does not necessitate broad fiscal stimulus, retain a targeted counter‑cyclical tool‑kit for any downturn, especially if growth diverges sharply from the 5‑7 % norm. Strengthen fiscal data reporting, particularly sovereign‑debt statistics, to enhance early‑warning accuracy.

**Conclusion**  
Tanzania has transitioned from a historically inflation‑dominated, medium‑risk profile to a more stable, low‑risk posture. Nonetheless, the legacy of high‑inflation episodes underscores the need for vigilant monetary policy, limited but ready FX management, and robust fiscal data systems. Continued prudent policy coordination will safeguard macro‑fiscal stability and support sustained growth.

Ollama Executive Summary: Zambia
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Zambia’s fiscal risk score averages 3.25, indicating modest but persistent vulnerability. Early‑1990s and the 2020‑2021 period register the highest alerts (HIGH), driven by sharp debt surges (peaking at 244 % of GDP in 1990) and runaway inflation above 100 %. Throughout the 1970s‑1990s the system repeatedly flagged MEDIUM risk, while the past decade has seen a mix of LOW and MEDIUM alerts, with a recent spike to HIGH in 2020 as debt rose above 100 % of GDP and inflation accelerated. Data gaps are evident: debt figures are missing for many years, limiting precise trend analysis.

**Key Trends**  
Two structural breaks dominate the record. The first, in the early 1990s, combined debt accumulation with hyper‑inflation, prompting automated advice for phased fiscal consolidation. The second, from 2015 onward, reflects a gradual debt build‑up, modest inflation, and a shift toward foreign‑exchange (FX) management recommendations. Since 2006, inflation has been contained below 20 % except for isolated peaks, while growth has remained positive except during global shocks (e.g., 2020). Policy guidance has evolved from counter‑cyclical stimulus in the 1970s to FX interventions in the 2000s and monetary tightening or fiscal consolidation in high‑risk episodes.

**Policy Implications**  
In the near term, reinforce fiscal discipline to keep consolidation at 1.5‑2 % of GDP, especially as debt trends upward. Complement this with targeted monetary tightening to anchor inflation expectations when inflation breaches 15 %. Strengthen FX market interventions and import‑compression tools to mitigate external vulnerability, but ensure they are calibrated to avoid undue pressure on the domestic economy. Finally, address data deficiencies by improving debt reporting and maintaining a robust early‑warning system.

**Conclusion**  
Zambia faces intermittent high‑risk windows linked to debt spikes and inflation bursts. A balanced mix of fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary tightening, and active FX management, underpinned by better data, will safeguard macro‑fiscal stability and support sustainable growth.

Ollama Executive Summary: Zimbabwe
============================================================
**Risk Profile**  
Zimbabwe’s fiscal risk score of 2.67 places the country in the medium‑risk band, with a recurring “MEDIUM” early‑warning flag throughout the historical record and a clustering of “LOW” flags only in isolated years of strong growth. The most acute vulnerabilities arise from hyper‑inflationary episodes (inflation above 250 % in 2019‑2022) and large, unquantified debt gaps—debt data are missing for every year, limiting precise debt‑sustainability analysis.

**Key Trends**  
From the 1970s onward, growth has swung between strong expansions and deep contractions, often triggering a switch from fiscal stimulus to foreign‑exchange (FX) management. Since 2010, inflation remained modest until 2018, when a 16 % surge signalled emerging price pressures. The period 2019‑2022 saw runaway inflation and a sharp contraction in output, prompting automated recommendations for aggressive monetary tightening. More recently, growth has modestly rebounded (5.4 % in 2023, 1.7 % in 2024) while inflation data are unavailable, but the pattern of “MEDIUM” risk flags continues, indicating persistent macro‑fiscal fragility.

**Policy Implications**  
To stabilise the macro‑environment, the finance ministry should prioritize a calibrated FX management regime—targeted interventions, import‑compression measures, and transparent foreign‑exchange allocation—to curb currency volatility. Simultaneously, the central bank must maintain a disciplined monetary stance, employing rate hikes to anchor inflation expectations when hyper‑inflation resurfaces. In years of negative or weak growth, a limited, well‑targeted fiscal stimulus can support vulnerable sectors without aggravating fiscal deficits, but must be financed through credible revenue reforms rather than opaque borrowing. Improving data collection on public debt and inflation will enhance early‑warning precision.

**Conclusion**  
Zimbabwe confronts medium‑level fiscal risk compounded by volatile growth and intermittent hyper‑inflation. A dual approach of prudent FX management, vigilant monetary tightening, and selective fiscal support—underpinned by better data—offers the clearest path to restoring macro‑stability and protecting the region’s financial cohesion.
